           for row in reader:
               if column_index < len(row):
                   value = float(row[column_index])
                   total += value
       return total
   ```

   Solution:
   ```python
   file_name = "data.csv"
   column_index = 2
   column_total = calculate_total(file_name, column_index)
   print("The total of column", column_index, "is:", column_total)
   ```

Throughout this module, you will learn how to work with files, handle exceptions, and process data stored in different formats. Practice the examples and projects to solidify your understanding of these concepts.

## Module 6: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Module 6 covers the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. OOP allows you to organize code into reusable and modular components called objects, making it easier to manage and maintain complex programs. By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of OOP principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### Topics Covered

1. **Introduction to OOP:**
   - Understanding the core principles of OOP.
   - Benefits of using OOP in software development.
   - Terminology: classes, objects, attributes, methods.

   Example: Creating a class and an object
   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age

       def greet(self):
           print("Hello, my name is", self.name)

   person1 = Person("Alice", 25)
   person1.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice
   ```

   Practice Project:
   - Create a class called `Rectangle` with attributes `width` and `height`. Implement a method called `calculate_area` that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.

   ```python
   class Rectangle:
       def __init__(self, width, height):
           self.width = width
           self.height = height

       def calculate_area(self):
           return self.width * self.height
   ```

2. **Class Constructors and Destructors:**
   - Using constructors to initialize objects.
   - Default constructors and parameterized constructors.
   - Destructor methods for cleanup actions.

   Example: Using a parameterized constructor
   ```python
   class Car:
       def __init__(self, make, model, year):
           self.make = make
           self.model = model
           self.year = year

       def display_info(self):
           print("Car:", self.make, self.model, self.year)

   car1 = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020)
   car1.display_info()  # Output: Car: Toyota Camry 2020
   ```

   Practice Project:
   - Enhance the `Rectangle` class by adding a constructor that accepts the `width` and `height` as arguments.

   ```python
   class Rectangle:
       def __init__(self, width, height):
           self.width = width
           self.height = height

       def calculate_area(self):
           return self.width * self.height
   ```

3. **Inheritance:**
   - Creating derived classes from base classes.
   - Inheriting attributes and methods from the base class.
   - Overriding methods in the derived class.
   - Accessing the base class methods using `super()`.

   Example: Creating a derived class
   ```python
   class Animal:
       def __init__(self, name):
           self.name = name

       def make_sound(self):
           print("The animal makes a sound.")

   class Dog(Animal):
       def make_sound(self):
           print("The dog barks.")

   animal = Animal("Generic Animal")
   animal.make_sound()  # Output: The animal makes a sound.

   dog = Dog("Rex")
   dog.make_sound()  # Output: The dog barks.
   ```

   Practice Project:
   - Create a derived class called `Square` from the `Rectangle` class. Implement a method called `calculate_perimeter` that calculates and returns the perimeter of the square.

   ```python
   class Square(Rectangle):
       def calculate_perimeter(self):
           return 4 * self.width
   ```

4

. **Polymorphism:**
   - Understanding polymorphism and its benefits.
   - Implementing polymorphism using method overriding and method overloading.

   Example: Polymorphism with method overriding
   ```python
   class Shape:
       def calculate_area(self):
           pass

   class Rectangle(Shape):
       def __init__(self, width, height):
           self.width = width
           self.height = height

       def calculate_area(self):
           return self.width * self.height

   class Circle(Shape):
       def __init__(self, radius):
           self.radius = radius

       def calculate_area(self):
           return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius

   shapes = [Rectangle(4, 5), Circle(3)]
   for shape in shapes:
       print("Area:", shape.calculate_area())
   ```

   Practice Project:
   - Create a class called `Triangle` that inherits from the `Shape` class. Implement the `calculate_area` method to calculate and return the area of the triangle.

   ```python
   class Triangle(Shape):
       def __init__(self, base, height):
           self.base = base
           self.height = height

       def calculate_area(self):
           return 0.5 * self.base * self.height
   ```

Throughout this module, you will learn the principles of OOP and how to apply them in your Python programs. Practice the examples and projects to solidify your understanding of these concepts.

       pass

   # File: rectangle.py
   class Rectangle:
       pass

   # File: main.py
   from shapes.circle import Circle
   from shapes.rectangle import Rectangle

   circle = Circle()
   rectangle = Rectangle()
   ```

   Practice Project:
   - Create a package called `utilities` with two modules: `string_utils.py` and `math_utils.py`. Implement various utility functions in each module. Import and use these functions in your main program.

   ```python
   # Package: utilities
   - __init__.py
   - string_utils.py
   - math_utils.py

   # File: string_utils.py
   def reverse_string(text):
       return text[::-1]

   # File: math_utils.py
   def square(number):
       return number ** 2

   # File

: main.py
   from utilities.string_utils import reverse_string
   from utilities.math_utils import square

       file.write("Hello, World!\n")
       file.write("This is a text file.")

   # Reading from a text file
   with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
       content = file.read()
       print(content)
   ```

   Practice Project:
   - Read a text file called `input.txt` and count the number of words in the file. Print the total word count.

   ```python
   word_count = 0

   with open("input.txt", "r") as file:
       for line in file:
           words = line.split()
           word_count += len(words)

   print("Total Word Count:", word_count)
   ```

2. **Working with CSV Files:**
   - Understanding CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file format.
   - Reading data from CSV files using the `csv` module.
   - Writing data to CSV files.
   - Manipulating CSV data using dictionaries and lists.

   Example: Reading and writing CSV files
   ```python
   import csv

   # Reading from a CSV file
   with open("data.csv", "r") as file:
       reader = csv.reader(file)
       for row in reader:
           print(row)

   # Writing to a CSV file
   data = [
       ["Name", "Age", "Country"],
       ["Alice", 25, "USA"],
       ["Bob", 30, "Canada"]
   ]

   with open("data.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
       writer = csv.writer(file)
       writer.writerows(data)
   ```

   Practice Project:
   - Read a CSV file called `employees.csv` that contains employee information (name, age, salary). Calculate and print the average salary of all employees.

   ```python
   total_salary = 0
   employee_count = 0

   with open("employees.csv", "r") as file:
       reader = csv.reader(file)
       next(reader)  # Skip header row

       for row in reader:
           salary = float(row[2])
           total_salary += salary
           employee_count += 1

   average_salary = total_salary / employee_count
   print("Average Salary:", average_salary)
   ```

3. **JSON Data Serialization:**
   - Introduction to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.
   - Serializing Python objects to JSON using the `json` module.
   - Deserializing JSON data to Python objects.
   - Reading and writing JSON files.

   Example: Serializing and deserializing JSON

   data = {
       "name": "Alice",
       "age": 25,
       "country": "USA"
   }

   json_data = json.dumps(data)
   print(json_data)

   # Deserializing JSON to Python object
   json_data = '{"name": "Alice

", "age": 25, "country": "USA"}'
   data = json.loads(json_data)
   print(data["name"])
   ```

   Practice Project:
   - Create a Python dictionary with student information (name, age, grade). Serialize the dictionary to JSON and write it to a file called `students.json`.

   ```python
   student = {
       "name": "Alice",
       "age": 15,
       "grade": 10
   }

   with open("students.json", "w") as file:
       json.dump(student, file)
   ```

Throughout this module, you will learn how to handle files, read and write data in various formats, and work with JSON for data serialization. Practice the examples and projects to enhance your understanding of file handling and data persistence in Python.
