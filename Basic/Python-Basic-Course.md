## Module 6: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Module 6 covers the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. OOP allows you to organize code into reusable and modular components called objects, making it easier to manage and maintain complex programs. By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of OOP principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### Topics Covered

1. **Introduction to OOP:**
   - Understanding the core principles of OOP.
   - Benefits of using OOP in software development.
   - Terminology: classes, objects, attributes, methods.

   Example: Creating a class and an object
   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age

       def greet(self):
           print("Hello, my name is", self.name)

   person1 = Person("Alice", 25)
   person1.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice
   ```

   Practice Project:
   - Create a class called `Rectangle` with attributes `width` and `height`. Implement a method called `calculate_area` that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.

   ```python
   class Rectangle:
       def __init__(self, width, height):
           self.width = width
           self.height = height

       def calculate_area(self):
           return self.width * self.height
   ```

2. **Class Constructors and Destructors:**
   - Using constructors to initialize objects.
   - Default constructors and parameterized constructors.
   - Destructor methods for cleanup actions.

   Example: Using a parameterized constructor
   ```python
   class Car:
       def __init__(self, make, model, year):
           self.make = make
           self.model = model
           self.year = year

       def display_info(self):
           print("Car:", self.make, self.model, self.year)

   car1 = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020)
   car1.display_info()  # Output: Car: Toyota Camry 2020
   ```

   Practice Project:
   - Enhance the `Rectangle` class by adding a constructor that accepts the `width` and `height` as arguments.

   ```python
   class Rectangle:
       def __init__(self, width, height):
           self.width = width
           self.height = height

       def calculate_area(self):
           return self.width * self.height
   ```

3. **Inheritance:**
   - Creating derived classes from base classes.
   - Inheriting attributes and methods from the base class.
   - Overriding methods in the derived class.
   - Accessing the base class methods using `super()`.

   Example: Creating a derived class
   ```python
   class Animal:
       def __init__(self, name):
           self.name = name

       def make_sound(self):
           print("The animal makes a sound.")

   class Dog(Animal):
       def make_sound(self):
           print("The dog barks.")

   animal = Animal("Generic Animal")
   animal.make_sound()  # Output: The animal makes a sound.

   dog = Dog("Rex")
   dog.make_sound()  # Output: The dog barks.
   ```

   Practice Project:
   - Create a derived class called `Square` from the `Rectangle` class. Implement a method called `calculate_perimeter` that calculates and returns the perimeter of the square.

   ```python
   class Square(Rectangle):
       def calculate_perimeter(self):
           return 4 * self.width
   ```

4

. **Polymorphism:**
   - Understanding polymorphism and its benefits.
   - Implementing polymorphism using method overriding and method overloading.

   Example: Polymorphism with method overriding
   ```python
   class Shape:
       def calculate_area(self):
           pass

   class Rectangle(Shape):
       def __init__(self, width, height):
           self.width = width
           self.height = height

       def calculate_area(self):
           return self.width * self.height

   class Circle(Shape):
       def __init__(self, radius):
           self.radius = radius

       def calculate_area(self):
           return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius

   shapes = [Rectangle(4, 5), Circle(3)]
   for shape in shapes:
       print("Area:", shape.calculate_area())
   ```

   Practice Project:
   - Create a class called `Triangle` that inherits from the `Shape` class. Implement the `calculate_area` method to calculate and return the area of the triangle.

   ```python
   class Triangle(Shape):
       def __init__(self, base, height):
           self.base = base
           self.height = height

       def calculate_area(self):
           return 0.5 * self.base * self.height
   ```

Throughout this module, you will learn the principles of OOP and how to apply them in your Python programs. Practice the examples and projects to solidify your understanding of these concepts.

       pass

   # File: main.py
   from shapes.circle import Circle
   from shapes.rectangle import Rectangle

   circle = Circle()
   rectangle = Rectangle()
   ```

   Practice Project:
   - Create a package called `utilities` with two modules: `string_utils.py` and `math_utils.py`. Implement various utility functions in each module. Import and use these functions in your main program.

   ```python
   # Package: utilities
   - __init__.py
   - string_utils.py
   - math_utils.py

   # File: string_utils.py
   def reverse_string(text):
       return text[::-1]

   # File: math_utils.py
   def square(number):
       return number ** 2

   # File

: main.py
   from utilities.string_utils import reverse_string
   from utilities.math_utils import square

   reversed_text = reverse_string("Hello, World!")
   squared_number = square(5)

   ]

   with open("data.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
       writer = csv.writer(file)
       writer.writerows(data)
   ```

   Practice Project:
   - Read a CSV file called `employees.csv` that contains employee information (name, age, salary). Calculate and print the average salary of all employees.

   ```python
   total_salary = 0
   employee_count = 0

   with open("employees.csv", "r") as file:
       reader = csv.reader(file)
       next(reader)  # Skip header row

       for row in reader:
           salary = float(row[2])
           total_salary += salary
           employee_count += 1

   average_salary = total_salary / employee_count
   print("Average Salary:", average_salary)
   ```

 url = f"https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/{base_currency}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            rates = response.json()['rates']
            if target_currency in rates:
                conversion_rate = rates[target_currency]
                converted_amount = amount * conversion_rate
                return converted_amount
            else:
                print(f"Exchange rate for {target_currency} not found.")
        else:
            print("Failed to fetch exchange rates.")

    # Example usage
    amount = 100
    base_currency = "USD"
    target_currency = "EUR"
    converted_amount = currency_converter(amount, base_currency, target_currency)
    print(f"{amount} {base_currency} is equal to {converted_amount} {target_currency}")
